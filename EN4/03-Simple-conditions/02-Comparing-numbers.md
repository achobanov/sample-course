# Comparing numbers

In programming, we can compare values using the following **operators**:

- Operator `<` (less than)
- Operator `>` (greater than)
- Operator `<=` (less than or equals)
- Operator `>=` (greater than or equals)
- Operator `==` (equals)
- Operator `!=` (inequals)

When compared the result is boolean value **true** or **false**, depending on whether the result of the comparison is true or false.

## Examples of comparing numbers

Note that when printing the **true** and **false** values in C # language, they are printed with a capital letter, respectively **True** and **False**.

### Comparison operators

In C #, we can use the following comparison operators:

| Operator               | Notation | Applicable for                           |
| :--------------------: | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Equals                 | ==       | numbers, strings, dates                  |
| Equals                 | ==       | numbers, strings, dates                  |
| Not equals             | !=       | numbers, strings, dates                  |
| Greater than           | >        | numbers, dates, other comparable objects |
| Greater than or equals | >=       | numbers, dates, other comparable objects |
| Less than |            | <        | numbers, dates, other comparable objects |
| Less than or equals    | <=       | numbers, dates, other comparable objects |
