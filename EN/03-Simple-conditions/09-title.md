# Exercises: simple conditions

Now let's practise the lessons learned in this chapter with a few exercises.

## Empty Visual Studio solution (Blank Solution)

We create a blank solution (**Blank Solution**) in Visual Studio to organize better the task solutions from the exercise  - each task will be in a separate project and all projects will be in common solution.

We run Visual Studio and create new **Blank Solution:** [**File**] -> [**New**] -> [**Project**].

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/00.Visual-studio-01.png alt="Empty VS Solution" /]

Choose from the dialog box [**Templates**] -> [**Other Project Types**] -> [**Visual Studio Solutions**] -> [**Blank Solution**] and give a appropriate project name, for example: “Simple-Conditions”:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/00.Visual-studio-02.png alt="Empty VS Solution" /]

Now we have empty Visual Studio Solution (no projects in it):

# Problem: excellent grade

[code-task title="Excellent grade" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]

[code-editor language=csharp]
var grade = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
The first exercise for this topic is to write a **console program** that **inputs the grade** (decimal number) and prints **Excellent!** if the grade is **5.50** or high.
[/task-description]

[code-io /]

[/code-task]

## Sample Input and Output

| Input |    Output   |
|-------|-------------|
| 6     | Excellent!  |
| 5     | (no output) |
| 5.5   | Excellent!  |
| 5.49  | (no output) |

## Create a new C # project

We create **a new project** in the existing Visual Studio solution. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on **Solution 'Simple-Conditions'**. Then choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**]:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-01.png alt="New Console Project" /]

A dialog box will open for selecting a project. We choose **C # console application** and create a name, for example "Excellent-Result":

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-02.png alt="New Console Project" /]

Now we have a solution with one console application in it. It remains to write the code to solve the problem.

## Writing the code

For this purpose we go into the body of the `Main (string [] args)` method and write the following code:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-03.png alt="Code" /]

**Run** the program with [**Ctrl+F5**], to test it with different input values:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-04.png alt="Console" /]

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-05.png alt="Console" /]

# Problem: excellent grade or not

[code-task title="Excellent grade or Not" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]
[code-editor language=csharp]
var grade = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
The next exercise from this topic is to write a **console program** that **inputs the grade** (decimal number) and prints **Excellent!** if the rating is **5.50** or higher , otherwise "**Not excellent.**".
[/task-description]

[code-io /]

[/code-task]

## Sample Input and Output

| Input |     Output     |
|-------|----------------|
| 6     | Excellent!     |
| 5     | Not excellent. |
| 5.5   | Excellent!     |
| 5.49  | Not excellent. |

## Create a new C # project

First we create **a new C# console project** in the **Simple-Conditions** solution.

- We click on the solution in Solution Explorer and choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**].
- We choose [**Visual C#**] -> [**Windows**] -> [**Console Application**] and create a name, for example: “Excellent-or-Not”.

Now we have to **write the code** of the program. We can help with the sample code from the picture:  

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/02.Excellent-or-not-01.png alt="Code" /]

## Auto set startup the project

We turn on mode to **automatic switching to the current project** by clicking on the main Solution with the right mouse button and choosing [**Set StartUp Projects...**]:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/02.Excellent-or-not-02.png alt="Set Startup Project" /]

A dialog box will appear and you have to choose [**Startup Project**] -> [**Current selection**]:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/02.Excellent-or-not-03.png alt="Set Startup Project" /]

## Test the app

Now **we run the program** as usual with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it if it works correctly:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/02.Excellent-or-not-04.png alt="Console" /]
[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/02.Excellent-or-not-05.png alt="Console" /]

# Problem: even or odd

[code-task title="Even or odd" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]
[code-editor language=csharp]

[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a program that checks whether an **integer** is **even** or **odd**.
Checking if the given number is even can be done with the operator `%`.
[/task-description]

[code-io /]

[/code-task]

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 2     | even   |
| 3     | odd    |
| 25    | odd    |
| 1024  | even   |

## Hints and Guidelines

Again, first we add **a new C # console project** in the existing solution. In the `static void Main ()` method, we have to write the program code. Checking if the given number is even can be done with the operator `%`, which will return the **remainder from an integer divided by 2** as follows: `var isEven = (num % 2 == 0)`.

Now we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/03.Even-or-odd-01.png alt="Console" /]

# Problem: Greater number

[code-task title="Greater number" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]
[code-editor language=csharp]
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a program that inputs **two integers** and prints the larger one.
[/task-description]

[code-io /]

[/code-task]

## Sample Input and Output

|  Input | Output |
|--------|--------|
|5<br>3  | 5      |
|3<br>5  | 5      |
|10<br>10| 10     |
|-5<br>5 | 5      |

## Hints and Guidelines

As usual, first we need to add a **new C # console project** to the existing solution. For the code of the program we need a single `if-else` construction. You can partially help with the code from the picture that is deliberately blurred to think about how to write it yourself:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/04.Greater-number-02.png alt="Code" /]

When we are done with the implementation of the solution, we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:

[image src=https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-EN/blob/master/assets/chapter-3-images/04.Greater-number-01.png alt="Console" /]

# Problem: equal words

[code-task title="Equal words" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]

[code-editor language=csharp]
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a program that **inputs two words** and checks if they are the same. Do not make difference between uppercase and lowercase letters. You have to print "**yes**" or "**no**".
[/task-description]

[code-io /]

[/code-task]

## Sample Input and Output

|        Input       | Output |
|--------------------|--------|
| Hello<br>Hello     | yes    |
| SoftUni<br>softuni | yes    |
| Soft<br>Uni        | no     |
| beer<br>vodka      | no     |
| HeLlO<br>hELLo     | yes    |

## Hints and Guidelines

Before comparing the words, turn them to a lowercase to avoid the letter size influence (uppercase / lowercase): `word = word.ToLower()`.

# Problem: area of figures

[code-task title="Print out Hello World" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]

[code-editor language=csharp]
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a program that ** inputs the sizes of a geometric figure** and **calculates its face**. The figures are four types: **square**, **rectangle**, **circle** and **triangle**.

The first line of the entrance reads the type of the figure (`square`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `triangle`).
- If the figure is **square**, the next row reads one number - the length of its side.
- If the figure is a **rectangle**, on the next two rows we read two numbers - the lengths of its sides.
- If the figure is **circle**, the next row reads one number - the radius of the circle.
- If the figure is **triangle**, on the next two rows we read two numbers - the length of the side and the length of its height.

Round the result up to the **third digit after the decimal point**.

# Problem: time plus 15 minutes


[code-task title="Print out Hello World" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code" requiresInput]

[code-editor language=csharp]
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a program that **inputs hours and minutes** from a 24-hour day and calculates how much it will be **after 15 minutes**. Print the result in **hh: mm** format. Hours are always between 0 and 23, and minutes are always between 0 and 59. Hours are written with one or two digits. Minutes are always written with two digits and zero at the front when needed.
[/task-description]

## Sample Input and Output

|   Input  | Output |
|----------|--------|
| 1<br>46  | 2:01   |
| 0<br>01  | 0:16   |
| 23<br>59 | 0:14   |
| 11<br>08 | 11:23  |
| 12<br>49 | 13:04  |

## Hints and Guidelines

Add 15 minutes and write a few conditions. If minutes are over 59, **increase hours** with 1 and **reduce minutes** with 60. Thereby look at the case when hours are over 23. When you print the minutes you should **check for zero at the front**.

## Hints and Guidelines

First check for **one-digit numbers** and if the number is one-digit, print the appropriate word for it. Then check for **two-digit numbers**. Print them in two parts: left part (**tenth** = number / 10) and right part (**units** = number % 10). If the number has 3 digits, it must be 100 and can be considered as a special case.
