# Calculations in Programming

We know that computers are machines that process data. All **data** is stored inside the computer memory (RAM) in **variables**. The variables are named areas in the memory, which keep a certain data type, for example a number or a text. Each of the **variables** in C# has a **name**, a **type** and a **value**. Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it with a value at the same time:

After being processed, data is again stored  in variables (in somе place in the memory saved for our program).

# Data Types and Variables

In programming, every variable keeps a certain **value** of some **type**. For example, data types can be: **number**, **letter**, **text** (string), **data**, **colour**, **picture**, **list** and others.
Here are some examples for data types:
- type **integer**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …
- type **float**: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
- type **character** (symbol): 'a', 'b', 'c', …
- type **text** (string): "Hello", "Hi", "Beer", …
- type **day of week**: Monday, Tuesday, …
